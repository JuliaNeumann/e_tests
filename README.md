## Master Thesis Project (MA program "Linguistics and Web Technology", University of Marburg, 2015)

This application offers the user the posibility to create, manage and run three types of interactive online tests, which could be used in an online e-learning platform. 

* _Crossword Tests_ - constructs a crossword from the given words
* _Drag-and-Drop Tests_ - allows assigning items to categories
* _Dynamic Multiple-Choice Tests_ - presents multiple-choice questions in a format that only shows one answer option at a time
